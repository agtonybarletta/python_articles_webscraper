The explosion destroyed the rocket and its payload, an Amos 6 communications satellite that Facebook wanted to use to provide internet to parts of Africa.\n\n\n\nThe accident grounded SpaceX\u2019s fleet of reusable rockets, which had been steadily building a record of landings.\n\nOn Saturday the Falcon 9 rocket landed successfully on a barge in the Pacific Ocean, the first landing on a new drone ship there, prompting the engineers to burst into cheers.\n\nThe latest launch was first scheduled for last Sunday, but intense storms forced delays. Commissioned by the telecom company Iridium, the rocket carried 10 communications satellites into space, the first of an intended satellite \u201cconstellation\u201d the Virginia-based tech giant means to use to replace its current global network of phone and data relays. Iridium has contracted SpaceX for $468m over seven launches.\n\nIn an investigation into last fall\u2019s explosion, SpaceX engineers concluded that a fault in the function of a helium tank caused the accident. The subsequent inquiry and safety delays pushed back the company\u2019s scheduled test of its new Falcon Heavy rocket and new tests of previously used rockets.\n\nElon Musk, the tech billionaire and CEO of SpaceX, told CNBC last year that the problem surprised engineers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s never been encountered before in the history of rocketry,\u201d he said. Giving few details about how helium might have frozen oxygen fuel to a dangerous temperature for the rocket engine, Musk said: \u201cThis is the toughest puzzle that we\u2019ve ever had to solve.\u201d\n\nInternal financial documents, reported by the Wall Street Journal, showed that such accidents can have dramatic consequences for a private spaceflight company. The documents showed that SpaceX suffered a $260m loss after a June 2015 explosion, and that the company did not likely meet its financial goals in 2016.\n\nThese struggles have not dimmed Musk\u2019s ambitions, however: he hopes to take humans to Mars by 2024 and to launch 4,000 SpaceX satellites.", "score": -0.08548750000000001, "title": "SpaceX successfully launches Falcon 9 rocket months after explosion"}, {"index": 1, "url": "https://qz.com/885060/spacexs-leaked-finances-show-elon-musk-is-betting-big-on-satellite-internet/", "article": "SpaceX does good business when the rockets are flying\u2014and becomes a money-loser when they\u2019re not, according to company financials published in the Wall Street Journal today (Jan. 13).\n\nThe behind-the-scenes peek at Elon Musk\u2019s privately held space business also reveals the company\u2019s hopes to generate enormous revenue from an ambitious effort to sell internet service from space.\n\nThe Journal reporters were able to access financial details from 2011 through 2015, the year that SpaceX suffered the loss of a rocket on a mission to the International Space Station. That incident put SpaceX deep into the red, as it was forced to delay launches for other clients until it decisively fixed the problem six months later.\n\nThe financials confirm the forthrightness of SpaceX CEO Musk, who told reporters shortly after the accident that it would entail losses of hundreds of millions of dollars for the company. Sure enough, the leaked financials reported a $250 million loss that year.\n\n\u201cSince 2002, we have been at the forefront of revolutionizing space technology, with a solid track record of success, strong customer relationships and more than 70 future launches on our manifest, representing over $10 billion in contracts,\u201d SpaceX CFO Bret Johnson said in a statement provide to Quartz. \u201cFurthermore, with over $1 billion in cash reserves and no debt, the company is in a financially strong position and is well positioned for future growth.\u201d\n\nSpaceX returned to flight in December 2015 and enjoyed nine months of successful launches until another incident in September, when one of its Falcon 9 rockets was destroyed during fueling before a routine engine test. The cause of the fire\u2014a pressurized tank stressed by an innovative, super-cold fueling technique\u2014was identified last week. SpaceX plans to return to flight tomorrow (Jan. 14) after returning to a more reliable fueling procedure.\n\nThe company\u2019s bullish projections for its satellite internet division are a highlight of the leaked documents. SpaceX expects revenue from the telecom project to exceed launch revenue by 2020, and to generate more than $15 billion in profit by 2025, the Journal reported.\n\nSpaceX\u2019s plan to launch a constellation of some 1,600 satellites in the next six years to beam internet service back to earth has been mostly revealed through regulatory filings, though Musk was caught on tape at the opening of the company\u2019s satellite-focused office in Seattle saying that this satellite constellation \u201cis intended to generate a significant amount of revenue and help fund a city on Mars,\u201d the company\u2019s longest-term ambition.\n\nBut the company may have adjusted its projections since then. Musk did not include satellite business revenue as a source of funding to SpaceX during a major presentation of his Mars ambitions in September 2016, even when asked about its role by Quartz afterward. SpaceX had planned to launch two test satellites for its constellation in 2016, according to a regulatory filing, but the launch did not occur, perhaps because of the delays following the two Falcon 9 losses.\n\nOther companies, including Boeing and OneWeb, which recently earned a $1 billion investment from Masayoshi Son\u2019s Softbank, are moving forward with their own plans for competing satellite internet constellations.\n\nSpaceX is majority-owned by Musk himself, and valued by at least one of its private-equity investors, Fidelity, at slightly more than $16 billion. Fidelity led a round with Alphabet in January 2015 to invest $1 billion in the company, in connection with the satellite internet plans. Peter Thiel\u2019s Founders Fund and DFJ Venture Capital also hold stakes in the firm.\n\nSpaceX\u2019s ability to out-compete traditional aerospace businesses for launch contracts led it to small operating profits from 2011 and 2014, giving it the cash margin to push through its recent losses.\n\nBut this report underscores how important tomorrow\u2019s return-to-flight launch is to SpaceX\u2019s financial soundness, and its future.", "score": 0.06737179487179489, "title": "SpaceX\u2019s leaked finances show Elon Musk is betting big on satellite internet"}, {"index": 2, "url": "https://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/elon-musk-has-delivery-issues", "article": "Just before President-elect Donald Trump met with leaders from Apple, I.B.M., Amazon, Facebook, and other tech companies in mid-December, the transition team made a somewhat puzzling announcement: Elon Musk, the head of Tesla, SpaceX and SolarCity, who would be attending the session in Trump Tower, had been named to the President\u2019s Strategic and Policy Forum, a new committee intended to advise the President on economic policy. The appointment seemed odd chiefly because Musk\u2019s political views\u2014he has been pro-immigration and against the Keystone XL Pipeline while supporting a carbon tax on businesses and expressing passionate concern about climate change\u2014would seem to veer far from Trump and his party. Still, whatever their ideological differences, Trump and Musk are not such an unlikely duo; they have many qualities in common. Both are outsized businessmen and public figures who have enjoyed hoopla and credulous press for their projects despite checkered records of success. Musk is best known as an innovator with unorthodox ideas. He created a car company from the ground up, building luxury electric cars with a devoted following. He jumped into solar energy and battery development on a big scale, vows to colonize Mars, and has said that we are probably living in a computer-simulated world. But, while his grand gestures inspire awe and curiosity, they often fall short in the execution. Since 2011, Tesla has failed to meet Musk\u2019s product-launch, production, and financial-performance promises more than twenty times, according to an analysis by the Wall Street Journal. Even a private showing, in early January, of Tesla\u2019s new Gigafactory, in Storey County, Nevada\u2014which Musk claims is on schedule to mass-produce lithium-ion batteries at rock-bottom costs by 2018\u2014didn\u2019t instill confidence in Musk\u2019s ability to achieve his stated goals. As the Pacific Crest Securities research analyst Brad Erickson said in a note, the tour left \"much to the imagination.\" And in September an explosion destroyed an unmanned SpaceX rocket on the launch pad during a fuelling exercise\u2014an incident that called into question the viability of Musk\u2019s radical notion to refuel craft en route, with astronauts on board. A little more than a year earlier, a NASA-funded SpaceX rocket carrying cargo destined for the International Space Station exploded two minutes after lift-off, destroying the payload. A NASA report on that incident raised questions about quality standards at Musk\u2019s company. The first unmanned SpaceX flight since the September accident is scheduled for later this month. Musk, however, is nothing if not self-assured, a quality he brings to an upcoming task: he has promised to devise an entirely new system for making automobiles, with levels of efficiency and productivity that have never been achieved before. He intends to do this with something he calls a \u201cmachine that builds the machine,\u201d a nearly fully automated factory that will assemble cars at speeds greater than any other global automaker. Beginning in 2018, this plant, an extension of Tesla\u2019s current facility in Fremont, California, is slated to produce as many as half a million vehicles each year, and Musk has previously promised to increase output by some fifty per cent every year. This is an extraordinary leap in production: in 2016, Tesla produced fewer than eighty-four thousand cars. In the auto industry, Musk\u2019s production assertions are viewed as the manufacturing equivalent of vaporware\u2014an advance that is promised but has very little chance of becoming a reality. The most efficient automakers\u2014companies such as Toyota and Honda that have spent decades studying, designing, and perfecting manufacturing systems and processes\u2014are unable to approach anywhere near the levels of production that Tesla, which isn\u2019t fifteen years old, is aiming for. Indeed, a prolific auto plant in the U.S., running three six-and-a-half-hour shifts a day, produces just more than four hundred thousand cars a year\u2014and only if it operates at peak efficiency virtually all of the time, without interruptions to deal with parts shortages, incorrectly sized or mismatched components, or design changes. The disparity between real-world factory output and Musk\u2019s goals likely means that many of the nearly four hundred thousand people who have already put down a thousand dollars to reserve a Tesla Model 3, which Tesla says will cost about thirty-five thousand dollars, will have to wait until 2019 or later for their cars. Even one of Tesla\u2019s most stalwart supporters in the investment community, the Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas, has reached the conclusion that the Model 3s will be late, and that there will be fewer of them than advertised. In November, he wrote, \u201cWe continue to forecast a Model 3 launch at the very end of 2018 (more than 1 year later than company target) with 60k units in 2019 and 130k units in 2020.\u201d\n\nMusk does not give many specifics about how he will produce so many cars, so quickly, in ways that have eluded his more experienced competitors. But he is unambiguous about one foundational principle: his ramp-up in production can come about only by eliminating humans from the manufacturing process as much as possible. \u201cYou really can't have people in the production line itself, otherwise you drop to people speed,\u201d Musk said on an earnings call in August. In this context, it\u2019s worth noting that the aim of the Trump advisory committee that Musk was appointed to is to figure out ways to \u201cmake it attractive for firms to create new jobs.\u201d Musk\u2019s plan for a fully automated, so-called \u201clights-out factory\u201d\u2014because robots can work in the dark\u2014is a strategy many in the industry consider to be a short-sighted. Humans can help improve efficiency by identifying shortcomings and conceiving of ways to do things that will shave time and cost from manufacturing processes. \u201cYou grow into automation,\u201d Jay Baron, president and C.E.O. of the Center for Automotive Research, told me. \u201cYou don\u2019t start with it.\u201d In one of his many public claims about his new plant, Musk expressed confidence that the assembly line would eventually move at about one metre per second, which Baron calculated as one car every fifteen seconds. Such a pace is twenty times the assembly line\u2019s current speed\u2014it\u2019s an almost comical pace, and one that raises serious questions about what Tesla would have to sacrifice to maintain this speed on the line. There are upwards of thirty thousand components in a typical car, and while Teslas have fewer, because its electric-propulsion system is a bit simpler than a gasoline-powered engine, making them is still a complicated process. At the speeds that Musk is anticipating, it would be virtually impossible for Tesla\u2019s network of suppliers to feed the assembly line with parts that meet high-quality standards without interruption. In addition, automakers budget a great deal of time to randomly inspect partially built cars for flaws and errors that could indicate larger problems with other vehicles on the line. Musk hasn\u2019t yet addressed these contingencies, all of which will affect the safety of his vehicles, and Tesla declined to comment further. Although the company\u2019s cars have been given high marks by Consumer Reports and Car and Driver for their on-road performance, Consumer Reports\u2019 2016 Annual Auto Reliability Survey ranked Tesla twenty-fifth out of twenty-nine brands. The magazine cited a slew of issues with the seventy-five-thousand-dollar (or more) Model X S.U.V. crossover, \u201cincluding frequent malfunctions of the falcon-wing doors, water leaks, and infotainment and climate-control system problems.\u201d Other concerning information has come out in recent months. As the Wall Street Journal reported, a design engineer for Tesla named Cristina Balan noticed in 2014 that Model S cars on the assembly line had an observable gap between the headliner (the material on the interior of the car\u2019s roof) and the trim on the adjacent support pillar. Worried that other, more critical parts didn\u2019t fit or meet tolerances, and upset that people were paying more than a hundred thousand dollars for shoddy workmanship, Balan told her managers and Musk about the problem. Over the next few months, Balan says she was demoted, harassed, and ultimately forced to quit\u2014even though she had been so integral to the development of Tesla\u2019s power system that her initials were engraved on each battery. Balan is now in arbitration with Tesla over her departure from the company. When Balan first left the company, she didn\u2019t ask for severance pay or even that her sacrificed stock options be allowed to vest, but only for a private meeting with Musk, which was rejected. She told me, \u201cI wanted to alert Elon, without lawyers or V.P.s present, that his company was in trouble. People are afraid of losing their jobs if they speak up and this will get worse as they try to mass-produce automobiles in a company that isn\u2019t ready to do that.\u201d Tesla denies that Balan was forced to quit over the issues she raised.", "score": 0.08581159420289847, "title": "Elon Musk Has Delivery Issues"}, {"index": 3, "url": "https://www.teslarati.com/elon-musk-obama-argue-cleantech-despite-political-uncertainty/", "article": "In spite of tremendous obstacles, Elon Musk has changed the way the world thinks about energy usage. He has defied odds with his rocket company SpaceX despite having to face-off against government-funded competition. He has pushed Tesla\u2019s direct sales model even when hit with major lobbying blockades from the Big Three car manufacturers in Detroit. Musk\u2019s Master Plan Part Deux outlined a vision for the future of sustainability and its necessity for the planet. It\u2019s an argument that many pundits have rejected as too costly, complicated, or just plain crazy.\n\nOn Monday, President Barack Obama wrote in the journal Science that a national policy to embrace renewable energy over a continued focus on fossil fuel production makes economic sense. President-elect Trump has decried calls for the U.S. to transition to alternative fuels.\n\nBoth Musk and Obama speak to energy policies that would change the way people heat their homes, commute to work, and depend on big utilities for energy provision. In his first Master Plan, Musk offered offered a pathway in which a low volume, expensive car would create a profit that would eventually be directed to create an affordable, high volume car. That first plan also emphasized the importance of solar power provision. He reiterated in Master Plan Deux that \u201cwe must at some point achieve a sustainable energy economy or we will run out of fossil fuels to burn and civilization will collapse.\u201d Increasing atmospheric and oceanic carbon levels threatens life on the planet, and Musk has said all along that the faster we achieve sustainability, the better.\n\nObama noted in the Science article that many businesses have come to the independent conclusion that reducing emissions is good for the environment and for profitability. He noted that millions of U.S. citizens already are employed in jobs related to energy-efficient technologies, adding that the cost of renewable energy has continued to decline, partly because of government incentives but primarily due to market forces. \u201cAlthough our understanding of the impacts of climate change is increasingly and disturbingly clear,\u201d Obama states, \u201cthere is still debate about the proper course for U.S. policy.\u201d Obama goes on to say that the United States is showing that greenhouse gas mitigation \u201cneed not conflict with economic growth. Rather, it can boost efficiency, productivity, and innovation.\u201d\n\nMusk\u2019s successful and sustainable business practices correlate with President Obama\u2019s conclusions. Tesla\u2019s commercial Powerpack system, alongside solar company SolarCity, combines integrated energy generation and storage. Tesla production goals include improved factory efficiency 5X to 10X by 2022, which will, in turn, make Tesla\u2019s vehicles more affordable. With radar, sonar, and advanced AI, Tesla\u2019s Autopilot may end up 10X safer than human drivers. Tesla\u2019s vision for the future is not limited to cars, as Musk wants to reinvent all kinds of vehicles such as massive electric 18-wheelers, which would dramatically reduce cargo shipping costs and could have revolutionary economic and environmental implications.\n\nThese types of alternative fuel innovations are just what Obama has outlined in his Science article. \u201cThe business case for clean energy is growing, and the trend toward a cleaner power sector can be sustained regardless of near-term federal policies,\u201d he writes, adding, \u201cI believe the trend toward clean energy is irreversible.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is always tension between the visionary and the day-to-day, but that\u2019s what causes things to happen as you figure out how the world is going to be,\u201d offers Ian Wright, whose startup, Tesla, has propelled Musk toward uber success. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to imagine how Elon does it all. He\u2019s human like everyone else.

This seemed impossible at first. Donald Trump has vacillated from tweeting that global warming was a Chinese \"hoax\" to admitting \"some connectivity\" between human activity and climate change. He's been a staunch supporter for the fossil fuel industry. His top appointees are part of the energy industry's old guard. The biggest example would be Trump's pick for Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, the former Chairman and CEO of ExxonMobil. How could it be possible for Trump to show any support for Tesla Motors [NASDAQ: TSLA] or its CEO Elon Musk?\n\nAbove: Donald Trump and Elon Musk (Image: Charged)\n\nWe reported early on that there might be an outside chance that Musk (and Tesla) could get an \"inside track\" to Trump via Musk's old PayPal business partner, Peter Thiel. This did, in fact, bear fruit once Musk was invited to Trump's tech industry summit which included 15 top Silicon Valley executives. Interestingly, only two execs, Tesla's Musk and Apple's Cook, were also allotted time for a separate, private meeting. In addition, Trump announced that Musk would be on the administration\u2019s Strategic and Policy Team, a group of business leaders that \u201cwill be called upon to meet with the president frequently to share their specific experience and knowledge as the president implements his economic agenda.\u201d\n\nAbove: Elon Musk at Trump's tech industry summit (Image: Electrek)\n\nAnd during Tesla's Gigafactory meeting with investors last week, Musk reportedly said that: \"The President-elect has a strong emphasis on US manufacturing and so do we. We are building the biggest factory in the world right here, creating US jobs\u2026 I think we may see some surprising things from the next administration. We don\u2019t think they will be negative on fossil fuels\u2026 but they may also be positive on renewables.\" A day after the Gigafactory meeting, Musk (again) made another visit to Trump Tower to meet with top advisors. Although the meeting was kept under wraps, Bloomberg provided some background...\n\nAbove: Musk visits Trump Tower again last week (Source: Bloomberg)\n\nThose on Wall Street have taken notice. CNBC has called Tesla a Trump stock. Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas wrote, \"To the extent that the creation of high-tech manufacturing jobs in the United States is a priority of the incoming administration, we believe Mr. Musk might have some interests that could be very much in alignment with those of President-elect Trump.\" Global Equities Research analyst Trip Chowdhry wrote, \"that Tesla CEO Elon Musk will be a 'very close confidant' to President-elect Donald Trump and both of them together will play a critical role to make 'USA manufacturing sexy again.'\u201d\n\nAbove: Job creation at Tesla's Gigafactory (Source: Bloomberg)\n\nHowever, little is known about what's been discussed thus far between Trump and Musk. One tidbit was just revealed in New York Magazine. Trump's son-in-law and top advisor, Jared Kushner was interviewed and it was reported that Kushner predicted that Trump would, \"invest in infrastructure, which he said could mean not only roads and bridges but high-speed internet and driverless cars. He said Trump had asked Elon Musk why the aerospace industry couldn\u2019t make planes that fly faster, like the Concorde used to, and Musk replied that most CEOs preferred incremental improvements to moon-shot risks. 'Trump will not be afraid to fail,' he said.\"\n\nAbove: Tesla's focus on U.S. manufacturing jobs could align with Trump's goals (Source: Market Realist)\n\nOkay... so maybe Trump's conversations with Musk are surrounding SpaceX or the Hyperloop. Or maybe they have something to do with Musk's intention to build tunnels. Or maybe, as Market Realist notes: \"Trump\u2019s administration will likely favor companies like Tesla... improving the US job market [which] is one of Trump\u2019s key agendas\" and Tesla is creating thousands of US jobs. Or, perhaps it's something more personal. After all, the Washington Post reported that Trump has a collection of cars, and \"Rounding out the fleet are two made in the USA: a Cadillac Escalade and a Tesla.\" So maybe... like the rest of us, he just fell in love with his Tesla.\n\nAbove: A Tesla Model S \"fueled\" by solar (Image: MIT Technology Review)\n\nRegardless, we hope that Elon Musk has an impact changing Trump's wrongheaded views on climate change. Yesterday, Mashable reported: \"A total of 640 businesses and investors sent a letter to President-elect Trump and Congress on Tuesday, strongly urging continued investment in the clean energy sector.\" Nancy Pfund, an early investor in Tesla and SolarCity, said the incoming administration should welcome the job creation by businesses that are pouring money into clean technologies. \u201cThis should be music to Trump\u2019s ears,\u201d she said, noting Tesla's recent job growth in California and Nevada.\n\nNext \u2192\n\n\u2190 Previous", "score": 0.2435822222222221, "title": "Donald Trump: Tesla owner and Elon Musk supporter?"}, {"index": 7, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/14/science/spacex-falcon-9-iridium-elon-musk.html", "article": "VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. \u2014 A Falcon 9 rocket roared into the sky on Saturday carrying 10 communications satellites \u2014 a return by SpaceX and its billionaire leader, Elon Musk, to the business of launching satellites to orbit.\n\nBut financial details disclosed this past week about the company overshadowed the successful liftoff, raising questions about the viability of Mr. Musk\u2019s long-range plans for SpaceX and his vision of sending people to Mars.\n\nSpaceX, based in Hawthorne, Calif., has been set back since September, when a different Falcon 9 caught fire and exploded on a launchpad in Florida, destroying the rocket and its payload, a $200 million Israeli satellite that Facebook had planned to lease to expand global internet services.

Copy that.\" To remedy the problem, the company is \"introducing a fleet-wide idle fee that aims to increase Supercharger availability,\" per a Tesla blog post.\n\n\"For every additional minute a car remains connected to the Supercharger, it will incur a $0.40 idle fee.\" If the car is moved within five minutes, the fee is waived.\n\n(An app alerts Tesla owners when the charge is nearly complete.)

On Saturday, the private aerospace start-up will launch another Falcon 9 rocket, complete with 10 satellites it intends to put into orbit for Iridium, a communications firm. The rocket will take off in California and, if all goes according to plan, will land upright on a drone ship in the Pacific.\n\nThe success of Saturday\u2019s launch could be critical for the future of SpaceX, or at least investor confidence. A new report from The Wall Street Journal details, for the first time ever, the state of SpaceX\u2019s finances, starting in 2011 and dating to 2015. SpaceX C.F.O. Bret Johnson told the Journal that SpaceX has no debt, $1 billion in cash on hand, and $10 billion in contracts. But losing rockets, as it turns out, is quite expensive. According to the Journal, SpaceX suffered a $250 million loss in 2015, putting a specific figure on the unspecified hundreds-of-millions-of-dollars loss Musk said SpaceX suffered that year.\n\nBut what is more revealing than SpaceX\u2019s finances is what the Journal\u2019s report reveals about the company\u2019s ambitions moving forward. The real money, it seems, isn\u2019t in rocket launches, per se, but in the residuals SpaceX could pull in from the sale of satellite-based Internet service from space. This would put Musk\u2019s core business in competition with companies like Google parent company Alphabet, a SpaceX investor that has been experimenting with its own nontraditional forms of Internet service, such as that beamed from balloons and drones, as well as terrestrial 5G high-speed Internet alternatives. But if SpaceX\u2019s projections for its Internet service are accurate, the initiative could become its main revenue driver, eventually subsidizing Musk\u2019s goal to send manned missions to Mars.\n\nDocuments reviewed by the Journal indicate SpaceX hopes to launch 4,000 communications satellites into space, beginning in 2018, with plans to have 40 million subscribers generating $30 billion in revenue by 2025. This doesn\u2019t necessarily align with Musk\u2019s aim to bring humans to Mars by 2020, but it\u2019s a step in the right direction. The Internet division at SpaceX yet doesn\u2019t have a complete team of engineers or a factory, the Journal reports, and the size of the space-Internet business is currently only $4.5 billion\u2014but if Musk can figure out a way to make it work, evolving into a full-service Internet telecommunications business could go a long way toward justifying SpaceX\u2019s lofty $12 billion valuation.\n\nElon Musk FOLLOW Follow to get the latest news and analysis about the players in your inbox.

Il lancio \u00e8 avvenuto come previsto alle 18,54 ora italiana (9:54 locali), dalla base aerea di Vanderberg in California e 2' 33\" secondi dopo, il primo stadio si \u00e8 distaccato dal secondo, che porta il carico 'pagante', rientrando con successo a terra, sulla piattaforma galleggiante predisposta nell'Oceano Pacifico, per poter essere riutilizzato in futuro. Musk, che guida anche la Tesla Motors, ha creato SpaceX nel 2002 proprio con l'obiettivo di lanciare satelliti e altri veicoli nello spazio con costi contenuti, creando vettori riutilizzabili per ridurre i costi della messa in orbita (al momento pari a circa 60 milioni di dollari a lancio, secondo il Wall Street Journal, cio\u00e8 un quarto del consorzio Boeing-Lockheed Martin).L'esplosione di quattro mesi fa, che un'accurata indagine ha attribuito a un difetto in uno dei serbatoi di ossigeno liquido nel secondo stadio del vettore Falcon 9, era stata per\u00f2 preceduta da un altro incidente nel giugno 2015. Fino ad allora SpaceX era riuscita a fare 18 lanci riusciti di fila (contro 100 della rivale Boeing-Lockheed Martin e 75 di Arianespace).Il secondo stadio ha messo in orbita con successo, un'ora e 19 minuti dopo il lancio, da un'altezza di 622 km, il primo gruppo dei 10 satelliti Next Iridium, sui 70 totali che saranno lanciati appunto a 10 alla volta con i Falcon 9, destinati a sostituire quelli attuali dell'unica rete cellulare satellitare che copre tutto il mondo. La costellazione originale Iridium \u00e8 stata messa in orbita tra il 1997 e il 2002. La nuova costellazione Iridium Next \u00e8 realizzata da Thales Alenia Space (joint venture franco-italiana 67% Thales, 33% Leonardo- Finmeccanica) e comprender\u00e0 in tutto 81 satelliti. L'operazione, che si dovrebbe concludere entro il 2018, \u00e8 stata definita il pi\u00f9 grande 'upgrade' della storia della tecnologia e mai tentato prima nello spazio.Ma l'azienda aerospaziale di Hawthorne vuole andare ben oltre e uno dei progetti annunciati prevede la messa in orbita di una rete di ben 4.425 satelliti, il triplo di quelli che attualmente orbitano intorno alla Terra, per fornire connessioni internet ad alta velocit\u00e0 in ogni angolo del pianeta. Il progetto era stato svelato agli inizi del 2015 dallo stesso Musk, che aveva stimato il costo dell'operazione in 10 miliardi di dollari, con investitori come Google e Fidelity, che insieme hanno contribuito per un miliardo. Stando al documento, i satelliti dovrebbero pesare 386 chilogrammi e orbitare a un'altitudine di circa 1.200 chilometri. progetto del sistema di Trasporto Interplanetario (Its), per colonizzare Marte . Il piano della azienda californiana, che ha in programma nel 2017 di lanciare i primi astronauti verso la Stazione Spaziale e di inviare su Marte una navetta automatizzata nel 2018, \u00e8 ancora tutto, o quasi, da sviluppare. A partire dal razzo vettore, che dovrebbe essere diverse volte pi\u00f9 potente del razzo di quarta generazione attualmente in fase di realizzazione. Il progetto Its prevede infatti di progettare un potentissimo razzo spinto da 42 motori Raptor, capaci di portare un carico 2 volte pi\u00f9 pesante delle missioni Apollo, e una navetta di 50 metri per ospitare fino a 200 astronauti. Il viaggio per Marte durerebbe appena 80 giorni e, nello scenario pi\u00f9 ottimistico, il costo per passeggero potrebbe essere di appena 100mila dollari.", "score": 0.3399999999999999, "title": "SpaceX riprende con successo lancio satelliti, esultano al quartier generale di Musk"}, {"index": 17, "url": "https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=it&u=https://www.repubblica.it/scienze/2017/01/14/news/spacex_riprende_con_successo_lancio_satelliti_esultano_al_quartier_generale_di_musk-156069586/&prev=search", "article": "", "score": 0, "title": "Google Translate"}]
