He also gave us some insight into the pace with which Tesla will be significantly revising the tech offered on existing models \u2014 big changes will come every year or year-and-a-half, on average.\n\nTesla will never stop innovating. People are buying the wrong car if they expect this. There will be major revs every 12 to 18 months. \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 22, 2017\n\nThat\u2019s definitely a more aggressive upgrade pace than you can expect from models offered by traditional automakers like GM, Ford and Toyota. Typically cars remain relatively static in their basic design for up to half a decade, acquiring new options and small features, but certainly not seeing \u201cmajor revs\u201d that can make the difference between enabling self-driving and not, as is the case with the HW1 and HW2 Model S and X.\n\nThis might rub some Tesla owners the wrong way; a Tesla is a huge investment, and seeing significant model revisions at a pace similar in frequency to how smartphones are updated can be frustrating. But as Musk notes, it\u2019s a trade-off Tesla is willing to make in order to push the envelope in innovation.\n\nIf we applied resources to doing super complex retrofits, our pace of innovation would drop dramatically \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 22, 2017\n\nMusk also noted that retrofitting older cars with HW2 kit would require extremely complicated and basically involve stripping the car to its frame, plus replacing over 300 parts. Focusing on updating existing cars would also impede Tesla\u2019s ability to create and improve new tech, he added.\n\nThe bottom line is that Tesla is a very different kind of car company from what consumers are used to, and that extends to their development cycle. To some extent, future-proofing is always partly actually handcuffing yourself to the past, and the trajectory Musk envisions for Tesla doesn\u2019t allow for much in the way of standing still, even in the interest of helping customers feel like they\u2019re getting more value out of their investment.\n\nI think Tesla\u2019s ability to compete with established industry leaders actually depends on adopting the revision paving of a tech company first, so it\u2019s good to see Musk commit to substantial changes at such a fast clip.", "score": 0.19983000000000006, "title": "Elon Musk says to expect \u201cmajor\u201d Tesla hardware revisions almost annually"}, {"index": 2, "url": "https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/822985910782283776?lang=en", "article": "Tweet with a location\n\nYou can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

He developed an interest in computers at the young age of 10, taught himself to code and by 12, sold his first computer program (a game called Blastar).\n\nBy 1992 he\u2019d already earned two degrees \u2014 one in physics and the other in business \u2014 and then dropped out of a Ph.D at Stanford to establish his first company, Zip2.\n\nBy 1999, Musk was a millionaire, having sold his company to Compaq for a whopping $340 million. The same year, Musk founded X.com, a financial services and payments company, which later became PayPal.\n\nPayPal was acquired in 2002 by eBay for a price of $1.5 billion.\n\nAnd again, not even waiting to catch his breath, Musk founded SpaceX that same year and Tesla Motors the year after.\n\nBut what was the inspiration behind SpaceX? As Musk himself explains, he intended to launch a greenhouse of sorts to Mars and start a colony there. This was around the time of PayPal\u2019s acquisition by eBay. He was on the lookout for some way to do this and discovered that while the lander could be cheaply built, the cost of sending it to Mars would be exorbitant.\n\nRealising that he could simply do something about it, Musk, along with a handful of veteran engineers, established SpaceX. The idea was to make commercial space travel a reality, with a human settlement on Mars soon after.\n\nSince then, the company earned a number of accolades of the type that will put many a country\u2019s space program to shame.\n\nAchievements galore\n\nBy 2008, SpaceX was the first privately funded company to take a rocket to orbit, by 2012 it became the first such company to dock a spacecraft with the ISS and by 2013, it had put a satellite into Geostationary Transfer Orbit (GTO). SpaceX is also among the only space-faring agencies in the world to have used and developed a reusable launch vehicle.\n\nThe Falcon 9 Full Thrust rocket\u2019s payload is double that of India\u2019s GSLV and if Musk sticks to his plan of launching a human-crewed spacecraft this year, his company will join Russia and China as among the only agencies capable of launching a human to space. Since the scrapping of Nasa\u2019s Space Shuttle program in 2011, the US space agency has no vehicle capable of launching a human to space.\n\nBut how did Musk do it? How did he establish SpaceX as a company that\u2019s mentioned in the same breath as Nasa, a company that\u2019s easily competing with the ESA (European Space Agency) for capability and cost and far outstrips India\u2019s own space program in terms of capability?\n\nThe only reasons I can think of are passion and focus. Musk has been determined to make commercial spaceflight a reality and in a mere 14 years, he\u2019s done just that.\n\nNasa\u2019s budget woes and the cancellation of its Space Shuttle replacement gave SpaceX the very windfall it needed to take off. Musk\u2019s Falcon 9 rocket alone represents a significant cost savings for Nasa, allowing it to focus on more ambitious projects, such as the recent Juno mission, the Curiosity rover and more.\n\nCurrently, SpaceX\u2019 launch costs work out to about $2,500 per pound to orbit (or about $5,600 per kg). The upcoming Falcon 9 Heavy will bring this cost down to $1,000 per pound to orbit. There is literally no other space agency in the world. India\u2019s PSLV is cheaper to launch, but with a payload that\u2019s a fraction of the Falcon 9\u2019s, pound-for-pound, the costs are still comparable.\n\nWith a little over $1 billion in funding, SpaceX has almost as much money to play around with as India\u2019s Isro. Is it any wonder that SpaceX is competing on a global scale?\n\nAgain, comparing Isro and SpaceX, Isro put a satellite into GTO with a completely indigenous rocket only in 2014, a year after Musk. India\u2019s GSLV used a Russian cryogenic stage to put satellites in GTO. The indigenously developed CE-7.5 cryogenic engine was used only in 2014.\n\nFiring imaginations\n\nAs to SpaceX\u2019s mass appeal, just watch Musk\u2019s \u2018Making humans an in interplanetary species\u2019 video below.\n\nAt a time when most technology companies are playing it safe, Musk comes up with a plan to colonise Mars!\n\nYou may call him mad, a lunatic, you may call his dreams impossible, but you have to admit, it\u2019s a pleasant change from the regular tech rhetoric of AI, bringing internet access to billions and, well, even more smartphones.\n\nMore than the boldness of the plans, it\u2019s Musk\u2019s passion that gets through to us. Ayrton Senna isn\u2019t the motorsport God he is just because he won races, that happened anyway; it\u2019s his passion for the sport that made him a hero.\n\nSpaceX is more than a mere space program. It\u2019s the passion project of one man, and his passion and ambition are infectious. Isn\u2019t every successful launch that little bit more special because you know that it\u2019s a step closer to humanity\u2019s Mars ambitions? There's no way that something like Amazon's Blue Origins can compete with that.\n\nTech2 is now on WhatsApp. For all the buzz on the latest tech and science, sign up for our WhatsApp services.

Model S sedan that drove itself into the side of a truck in May had ignored the manufacturer\u2019s warnings to maintain control even while using the driver-assist function. The agency said it found no defect in the vehicle and wouldn\u2019t issue a recall.\n\n\u201cThe auto industry just let out a giant sigh of relief,\u201d said Dave Sullivan, an analyst at consultancy AutoPacific Inc. \u201cThis could have started a snowball effect of letting automakers and suppliers become liable for human error.\u201d\n\nThe finding concludes NHTSA\u2019s first investigation into the role played by automated driving systems in a fatal crash. It was a win for not only for Tesla but for companies from General Motors Co. to Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google that have invested billions of dollars in what they see as the future of personal transportation. Safety regulators, too. have backed the nascent industry, giving it the flexibility to develop products that they think could greatly reduce highway deaths.\n\n\u2018Very Positive\u2019\n\nTesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk called the NHTSA report \u201cvery positive.\u201d In a Twitter message he highlighted data showing the company\u2019s vehicle crash rate dropped by 38 percent after the company installed its auto-steer system.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate the thoroughness of NHTSA\u2019s report and its conclusion,\u201d Tesla said in an e-mailed statement. Some auto-safety advocates have criticized Tesla for what they said was a premature introduction of its Autopilot system and said NHTSA could have taken stronger action.\n\n\u201cIf a vehicle could not distinguish between a white truck and the sky, that to me would seem to be a defect,\u201d said Joan Claybrook, NHTSA administrator under President Jimmy Carter and an auto safety advocate.\n\nStephanie Brinley, a senior analyst at IHS Markit Ltd.\u2019s automotive group, cautioned that it\u2019s too early to draw too many conclusions about self-driving vehicles from the findings.\n\n\u201cThis decision does not in and of itself tell us what will happen down the road,\u201d Brinley said. \u201cIt\u2019s really too soon. \u201d\n\nSelf-Driving Risks\n\nNHTSA didn\u2019t completely absolve self-driving technologies. The agency drew several observations about the limits of automated driver-aids and the risks associated with how drivers use them.\n\nAutomatic braking systems like the one on the Model S and those increasingly available on other new vehicles can\u2019t address all crash scenarios, NHTSA spokesman Bryan Thomas said. The crash in May that killed Joshua Brown, a former Navy SEAL and Tesla enthusiast, in Florida is an example of that, Thomas said.\n\nThe Model S\u2019s sensors couldn\u2019t distinguish the trailer against a bright sky as it attempted to cross the highway while making a left turn. Auto-braking systems are best at preventing rear-end collisions, not the cross-traffic collision that led to Brown\u2019s death, Thomas said.\n\n\u2018Full Attention\u2019\n\nSo-called Level 2 automated driver systems like Tesla\u2019s Autopilot, which provide automated driving functions in limited circumstances, continue to require a driver\u2019s \u201cfull attention,\u201d Thomas said.\n\nCarmakers must anticipate that some drivers will fail to do so and design their systems with the \u201cinattentive driver in mind,\u201d he said. He also signaled that automakers will be expected to provide clearer warnings about the limitations of automated driver aids, saying NHTSA believes \u201cstrongly\u201d that \u201cit\u2019s not enough to simply put it in an owner\u2019s manual.\u201d\n\nSince the accident, Tesla added protections to its software that shuts off Autopilot if it detects the driver isn\u2019t paying attention. The software also emphasizes radar over cameras, and Musk has said that change would have made it easier for the car in the crash to detect the truck and might have saved Brown\u2019s life.\n\nNTSB Probe\n\nThe California-based group Consumer Watchdog said Tesla should have been held accountable for the accident.\n\n\u201cNHTSA has wrongly accepted Tesla\u2019s line and blamed the human, rather than the Autopilot technology and Tesla\u2019s aggressive marketing,\u201d John Simpson, the group\u2019s privacy project director, said in an e-mailed release. \u201cThe very name Autopilot creates the impression that a Tesla can drive itself. It can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board, an independent agency that has no regulatory power, is conducting a parallel investigation of the accident. The safety board is planning to issue its conclusions by early summer, spokesman Christopher O\u2019Neil said.\n\nIn spite of the crash, the Tesla Autopilot system appears to have improved the safety of its vehicles overall. Crash rates in Tesla vehicles equipped with the Autosteer system fell by 38 percent to 0.8 per million miles compared to those without it, NHTSA said in its report.\n\nThomas said Tesla was \u201cfully\u201d cooperative and provided data on what he estimated were \u201cdozens\u201d of Tesla Model S and Model X crashes in which Autopilot was active during the crash or 15 seconds prior.\n\nTesla was able to pull crash data directly from its vehicles, providing the agency access that \u201cwould not have been possible just a few years ago or with other automakers.\u201d\n\nTesla advanced as much as 4.3 percent in U.S. trading and closed up 2.3 percent at $243.76 per share, its highest since April 28. Shares got an early boost from a Morgan Stanley upgrade.\n\nCopyright 2019 Bloomberg.", "score": -0.001632894736842137, "title": "Investigation Concludes Tesla Not at Fault in Self-Driving Car Crash"}, {"index": 9, "url": "https://insideevs.com/top-3-lessons-learned-tesla-ceo-elon-musk/", "article": "JAN 22 2017 BY STEVEN LOVEDAY\n\nINNOVATION INSIGHTS: THREE LESSONS FROM TESLA CEO ELON MUSK\n\nTesla Motors\u2019 CEO Elon Musk is recognized around the world as a \u201ca modern visionary deserving of all our respect.\u201d That\u2019s what the India Times recently reported as they compared Musk to other tech icons. \u201cThe late Steve Jobs of Apple, Bill Gates of Microsoft, Sergey Brin and Larry Page of Google, and more recently Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg have all discussed their vision of the world.

Authored by Matt Pressman. The opinions expressed in these articles are not necessarily our own at InsideEVs.\n\nWhy? \u201cThe inspiration behind Iron Man\u2019s Tony Stark persona and currently the 117th richest person in the world with a $10 billion net worth (according to Bloomberg), not to mention with an ex-wife as good as English actress Talulah Riley (of HBO\u2019s Westworld fame), Elon Musk\u2019s an entrepreneur who has founded (and is running) a lot of innovative companies of our time \u2014 Tesla Motors, SpaceX, OpenAI, and SolarCity \u2014 that are inventing or mass producing tech-fueled solutions to some of humanity\u2019s biggest 21st century problems\u2026 (and that\u2019s) why we all owe our allegiance to Elon Musk!\u201d\n\nAbove: A 90-second look at Elon Musk\u2019s rise to fame (Source: The Telegraph)\n\nAnd UK\u2019s Telegraph also just featured Musk (see above) in a recent series celebrating icons in the tech sector. The Telegraph reminds us that long before Tesla and SpaceX, \u201cThe South African-born entrepreneur immigrated to Canada ahead of his 18th birthday and later moved to the US. He began a PhD in applied physics and materials science at Stanford University but dropped out after just two days to set up his first company, becoming a millionaire by the age of 28.\u201d For innovators to learn more from this inspiring figure, the folks over at Innovation Excellence* highlight three key insights from Elon Musk\u2026\n\nThink big\n\nElon Musk is not interested in just starting successful companies. He has a vision of space exploration for the benefit of mankind. He wants to find radically new and cleaner ways of transporting people. In his own way, he wants to use science and entrepreneurship to make the world a better place. He has set out to make a big impact. If you have a big vision then it can inspire people and give you and your team a stronger sense of purpose and value.\n\nBypass the normal channels\n\nTesla Motors sells direct to end-users. It has \u2018galleries\u2019 in shopping malls rather than expansive dealer showrooms. It makes all its patent innovation transparent and available to others. It is refreshingly different from conventional car companies and this increases its appeal to people who want an unconventional and cleaner car.\n\nUse one success to build another\n\nElon Musk did not settle back after selling his first internet start-up. When he made his first millions he did not retire to a villa on the beach. He used his early successes to fuel his big ambitions. If you have an early victory then use it as a platform for further bigger and bolder ventures.\n\n===\n\n*Source: Innovation Excellence\n\n*Editor\u2019s Note: EVANNEX, which also sells aftermarket gear for Teslas, has kindly allowed us to share some of its content with our readers, free of charge.

Not surprising, but worth noting considering how crowded some popular Supercharger locations have become (especially early ones with only a few charging stalls).\n\nThe words used by the company CEO in the tweet were \u201cincreasing capacity at existing Supercharger locations,\u201d which is a bit ambiguous. Does \u201cincreasing capacity\u201d relate to improved charging times as well, in addition to increased stall numbers?\n\nHere\u2019s the tweet:\n\n@matt_mantyla @TeslaMotors Increasing capacity at existing Supercharger locations now has top priority.

That should help to reduce some of the congestion at busy Supercharger locations, but not all of it.\n\nThis news also follows Tesla\u2019s move to eliminate unlimited free-for-life Supercharging on new Tesla Model S and Model X sales, a change which went into place yesterday.\n\nTeslarati provides more context: \u201cMusk acknowledged on Twitter that some of the busier Supercharger locations are \u2018overflowing\u2019 while others nearby remain empty. To address the issue, Tesla will focus on the expansion of Supercharger stalls at existing locations. We saw the same behavior take place during the early days when the majority of Supercharger stations had only four stalls but later expanded to eight and twelve stalls.\u201d\n\nWith the above in mind, Tesla will reportedly be introducing a means of monitoring Supercharger utilization to help drivers find an available station when they need one. The improvement will of course come via a software update, probably sometime this year.

According to the LA Times, Elon Musk\u2019s portfolio of companies has benefited in $4.9 billion in government subsidies. The figure compiled by The Los Angeles Times, explains reporter Jerry Hirsch, comprises a variety of government incentives, including grants, tax breaks, factory construction, discounted loans and environmental credits that Tesla can sell. It also includes tax credits and rebates to buyers of solar panels and electric cars. \u201cMusk and his companies\u2019 investors enjoy most of the financial upside of the government support, while taxpayers shoulder the cost,\u201d Hirsch adds. \u201cHe definitely goes where there is government money,\u201d said Dan Dolev, an analyst at Jefferies Equity Research. \u201cThat\u2019s a great strategy, but the government will cut you off one day.\u201d Elon Musk has not been cut off from having an advisement role within the incoming Trump administration, yet the billions of tax payer dollars he has received would be the type of crony capitalism that Donald Trump campaigned against and had promised to end by \u201cdraining the swamp.\u201d\n\nSpreading His Wealth Around Citing that Hillary\u2019s environmental and economic policies were the \u201cright ones,\u201d he confirmed his feelings by donating $5,000 to Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign, yet most of his peers in Silicon valley were \u201cReady for Hillary.\u201d Data compiled by Crowdpac, a nonpartisan group that tracks campaign donations, shows that employees at technology companies donated overwhelmingly to Hillary Clinton. Of the $8.1 million given by tech employees or executives, Clinton got 95 percent, or $7.7 million; Donald Trump got 4 percent, or $299,000. Like Trump and many executives, Elon has given to both parties. According to Quartz: further digging into Musk\u2019s political giving since 2003 reveals a remarkable even-handedness, with the serial entrepreneur donating $258,350 to Democratic candidates and $261,300 to Republicans. Musk, like many executives, spreads his donations around; during the last election cycle, he gave money to both Democratic President Barack Obama and current Republican presidential candidate Senator Lindsey Graham. In total, Musk has given $519,650 to US politicians since 2003. His donations fall somewhere in the middle range of comparable executives. If you look at the following graph, Musk\u2019s political donations tend to ebb and flow with the rise and fall of political power in Washington DC: Like Trump and many executives, Elon has given to both parties, yet, Elon ideologically leans left when it comes to climate change and immigration reform.\n\nProgressive Posturing In 2013, Elon Musk withdrew his support, without comment, from a high-profile political group, FWD.us, founded by Facebook founder, Mark Zuckerberg. Yet, he was an initial supporter of this group who advocated and backed an immigration reform bill which would have put 10 million illegal immigrants on a path to citizenship. His political contributions were to both Lindsay Graham and Marco Rubio, who were a part of the Gang of Eight and outspoken Republican critics of President-elect Donald Trump. Tech executives, like Musk and Zuckerberg, were pushing for a comprehensive immigration bill because it would increase the number of highly-skilled foreign workers coveted by companies like Facebook and PayPal, which Musk co-founded. Musk withdrew his support within a week after the group funded ads promoting drilling in Alaska and a proposed oil pipeline between the United States and Canada. Additionally, Elon Musk stands in direct contrast with President-elect Donald Trump when it comes to the science of Global Warming/Climate Change. The Tesla CEO is a prominent proponent of using innovation to do something about global warming, while Trump has said climate change is a hoax. In 2015, Musk spoke to a San Francisco audience about the importance of innovation, renewable energy sources, and especially the need for a carbon tax. \u201cThis is essentially analogous to not paying for garbage collection,\u201d he said. \u201cWe cannot say \u2018let\u2019s have a garbage free society\u2019 because it\u2019s nearly impossible to have a garbage-free society. But people still need to pay for the garbage collection.\u201d Taxes on carbon emissions would help the world transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy, Musk said. There are major costs to consumption, in other words, and we can\u2019t see the whole picture and what climate change is really costing us. The issue of climate change is neither a right or left, liberal, or conservative issue, Musk said; it\u2019s a global issue and went on to say that \u201cwe should just end the experiment that is fossil fuels as soon as possible.\u201d As the owner of a solar company, these words come as no surprise. But the appointment of Elon Musk is a surprise\u2014and I am sure he was surprised by Donald Trump\u2019s ascendancy to the office of the President of the United States. In a Trump administration, which is focused on economic prosperity, job creation, and sovereignty, Elon is going to have to shelve some of his progressive ideals that were rejected in this past election and embraced by the very people he could one day employ\u2014-without tax-payer subsidies?

Or, you can link Musk's name with any number of his renown companies and projects - from PayPal to Tesla to SpaceX to Hyperloop One. We're pretty sure he's actually Tony Stark and we're waiting for him to unveil his fully functional Iron Man suit.\n\nWith Musk's 'crazy' ideas often come with equally off-the-wall statements. But we can't judge. We're not the CEO of multiple tech companies.\n\n[Image Source: Wikipedia Creative Commons]\n\nHere are 15 of our absolute favorite Elon Musk quotes. It was hard to narrow down; the man has a statement on nearly everything.\n\n\"There's a fundamental difference, if you look into the future, between a humanity that is a space-faring civilization, that's out there exploring the stars \u2026 compared with one where we are forever confined to Earth until some eventual extinction event.\"\n\nThis one will definitely make you think:\n\n\"Arguably we should hope that that's true, because otherwise if civilization stops advancing, that may be due to some calamitous event that erases civilization. So maybe we should be hopeful that this is a simulation, because otherwise... We are either going to create simulations indistinguishable from reality or civilization ceases to exist.\"\n\nBusiness Insider reported that he talked about this so much to others that he's vowed to stop discussing it in hot tubs. Admittedly, it's got to be a hard subject to stop debating. We also understand the need to discuss genesis theories with our friends in hot tubs.\n\nBecause nothing seems more covert than a cryptic message about secret government meetings. He also tweeted back at someone who asked if he liked being referred to as \"billionaire Elon Musk.\" His answer? \"No.\" When asked what was he doing at the Pentagon, he indirectly responded:\n\nSomething about a flying metal suit... \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 9, 2016\n\n\"We have essentially no patents in SpaceX. Our primary long-term competition is in China. If we published patents, it would be farcical, because the Chinese would just use them as a recipe book.\"\n\nAbout the Future\n\n\"We\u2019re trying to have the non-weird future get here as fast as possible.\" (via Inverse)\n\nOn Warming Up Mars\n\n\"The fast way is to drop thermonuclear weapons over the poles.\"\n\nYou can watch his full interview with Stephen Colbert below:\n\n\"I don't believe in process. In fact, when I interview a potential employee and he or she says that 'it's about the process,' I see that as a bad sign.\"\n\nWe'll keep that one in mind before sending you a resume.\n\n\"[My biggest mistake is probably] weighing too much on someone's talent and not someone's personality. I think it matters whether someone has a good heart.\"\n\nThis might be the best idea for an office ever, but we're surprised Pixar Studios hasn't already done this yet.\n\n\"Everybody around here has slides in their lobbies. I\u2019m actually wondering about putting in a roller coaster \u2014 like a functional roller coaster at the factory in Fremont. You\u2019d get in, and it would take you around [the] factory but also up and down.
